Creating a Safe Space for our Community of Users.
One of our main aims and mission at Joinmonie is to create a safe space for you as the user either to get your funds raised or to throw in your great donations to the causes you care for; that is why we have created mediums to help us keep the community safe and avoid people misusing our platform.
Safety Tips;
How to identify fundraising scams: Identifying fundraising scams might be as hard as rocket science but we highly suggest that before you donate, you read and understand perfectly the description, campaign photo and funds required of the campaign you wish to donate to. This way, you get to understand the campaign perfectly before donating.
Reporting campaigns: To further strengthen the security and improve reliability of campaigns, we created a feature giving users the ability to report ANY campaign that looks suspicious for various reasons.
Be rest assured we are with you: Even though we have created features that would help you as the user tackle fundraising scams, we are with you all the way and be rest assured that our team reviews all campaigns immediately they are published.
