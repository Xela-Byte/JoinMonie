	<div class="Vision">
	  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
	  <p>To get as many as 500,000 campaigns and ideas funded and well developed by <br> the COMMUNITY no matter the category (health, education, social, economic, technology/art).<br> With Joinmonie, you can pay that hospital bill, school fees, <br> get capital for your business and so much more from donations made by wonderful people.
</p>
     <h3>Our Mission</h3>
     <p>
To create a safe medium and reduce the complexity that comes with <br> creating fundraising campaigns with other platforms and giving users a chance to both donate and be donated for. <br>
With this stability that comes with getting your campaigns and businesses funded easily; </p>

<ul>
  <li>Thereâ€™s a high chance in the reduction of mortality rate as people could get their health bills taken care of, therefore saving their lives.</li>
  <li>
    A great reduction in the unemployment rate as users can get capitals raised for their dream businesses.
  </li>
  <li>
    An increase in literacy as people will not have a reason to drop out from schools as school fees and other expenses could be raised on Joinmonie.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>WE AT JOINMONIE DO BELIEVE THAT ALL THE AFOREMENTIONED COULD BE WELL <br> TAKEN CARE OF AND ACHIEVED WITH OUR PLATFORM.
